# Data-Decluttering-Model


Overview
<br>
Hello! I've created PhoneTester, a Python application that's designed to provide detailed information about phone numbers. My project leverages various libraries to parse, validate, and extract information from phone numbers entered by users.

<br>

Features
<br>
Here are the key features of my application:
<br>
Number Parsing: It separates the country code and the national number from the phone number you enter.
Number Validation: The app checks if the provided phone number is valid.
Geolocation: It identifies the country to which the phone number belongs.
Carrier Identification: Determines the service provider associated with the phone number.
